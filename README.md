# CSE6250 Playground Notebooks
> Playground notebooks I have come to accrue and play around with while working through the 
GaTech CSE6250 Big Data for Health Analytics course

Over the course of the class, I have managed to accrue some IPython and Zepellin notebooks 
for the purpose of data explorations. Sometimes, I also managed to open up a notebook 
to quickly write small pieces of code that I wanted to evaluate without having to 
recurse through my assignment and see where potential errors are emanating from.

### IPython vs Zepellin
IPython/Conda notebooks tend to shine on usage with the Python ecosystem/small "localized" 
datasets that can be stored/processed in your own personal computer.

Zepellin shines on the use of JVM languages as well as data processing/storage that has to be done 
across a cluster, using various "big data" tools (which the Java and the JVM ecosystem 
tend to be used a lot today with based on the rise to prominence of several Java-based 
Apache Big data tools used in the industry like **Spark**, **Storm**, **Kafka**, **HDFS** 
and so forth).

### What's on this repo?
You can directly view IPython notebooks on GitHub as GitHub comes with a built in IPython 
Notebook Viewer. However, for Zepellin notebooks, you can view them so through these URLs:

**Bonus**: nice charts and some simple pre-Machine Learning model data investigation to 
determine size of dimension reduction and so forth!
